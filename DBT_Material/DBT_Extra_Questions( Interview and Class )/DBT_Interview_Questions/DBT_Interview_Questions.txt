1. Create Emp table containing a Sal column with the following sample data:-
EMP
------
SAL
------
8000
7000
6000
5000
10000
9000
4000
8000
7000
Write a SELECT statement to display the Overall 5th largest Sal.
Assuming the above data, the Overall 5th largest Sal would be 6000. Do not make use
of Rownum.
Ans:
SELECT SAL FROM EMP E1 WHERE 6 = (SELECT COUNT(SAL) FROM EMP E2 WHERE E2.SAL > E1.SAL);







2. For the above table, write a SELECT statement to display the Largest and Second
largest Sals (next to each other). Your output should be as below:-
FIRST		SECOND
--------	---------
10000		9000

Ans:
SELECT (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP) 'FIRST', 
(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP)) 'SECOND';




```
(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP))) 'THIRD';
```



3. Create Emp table containing an Empno column with the following sample data:-
EMP
-------
EMPNO
-----------
1
1
2
3
3
4
4
4
5
6
Write a DELETE statement to delete the duplicate rows. After running your Delete
statement, one occurrence of each value of Empno should remain in the table.
Ans:

DELETE FROM E1 WHERE E1.EMPNO = (SELECT E1.EMPNO FROM EMP GROUP BY (E1.EMPNO) HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);








4. Create Emp table containing an Empno column with the following sample data:-
EMP
-------
EMPNO
-----------
5
9
1
14
25
20
Write a SELECT statement to display the range of missing numbers. Your output
should be as follows:-
MISSING
------------
2–4

sample data:-
BANK		WITHD
---------	--------
DEPO

Balance
----------
2000
3000
5000


Ans:





6. Write a SELECT statement to display the experience of all the employees (Sysdate –
Hiredate). Your output should be as follows:-
5 years 7 months 11 days
9 years 3 months 16 days
etc.
Don’t assume that there are 365 days in a year or that there are 30 days in a month.
Your solution should even take care of leap years.
Ans:

SELECT 
    (SYSDATE() - HIREDATE) AS YEAR,
    SUBSTR(SYSDATE() - HIREDATE, 3, 2) AS MONTH,
    SUBSTR(SYSDATE() - HIREDATE, 5, 2) AS DAYS,
    SUBSTR(SYSDATE() - HIREDATE, 7, 2) AS HOURS,
    SUBSTR(SYSDATE() - HIREDATE, 9, 2) AS MINUTES,
    SUBSTR(SYSDATE() - HIREDATE, 11, 2) AS SECONDS
FROM EMP_HIRING_DATE;






7. Write a SELECT statement to achieve Number to Word conversion. You have to spell
